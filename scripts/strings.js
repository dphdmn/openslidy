const helpMessage = `- Specify size in "12x34" format. Click buttons for more format examples. Separate with ", ". Case doesn't matter.
- Use "ao5", "ao12", "ao50", or "ao100" for average. Otherwise it is single by default. ("avg" instead of "ao" also possible)
- Solve type format: "wrel" (width relay), "hrel" (height relay), "rel" (normal relay), "eut" (eut relay), "bld" (BLD), or "x123" (marathon of N).
- Only one display type is supported globally (check settings in header!).
- Use spacebar once and only after puzzle size (recommended for better look).
- Input format isn't checked, so if it can't be detected, it will be ignored.
- Player's final Kinch ranking is weighted with N = 10: AVG(X^N)^1/N (customization of it is probably not very important, but may change later).`;
